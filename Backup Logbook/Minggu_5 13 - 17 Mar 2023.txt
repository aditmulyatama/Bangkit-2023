Apa yang kamu pelajari minggu ini?

This week, I learned a lot of new things. I learned about “Prepare Data for Exploration,” which teaches me how to get data from different sources and prepare them to be cleaned. I also learned about how to clean up data, such as by removing duplicates, removing null values, etc. After that, I learned how to visualize data by using Tableau, which is a very useful tool for data visualization. The next day, I learned about vectors, handling a vector, and vector operations such as multiplying and addition. And in the last day, I learned about finding the modulus (size), the angle between vectors (dot or inner product), and projections of one vector onto another
